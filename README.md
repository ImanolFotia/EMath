# EMath
Open Source Math Library used by the Epsilon Engine, oriented to game programmers.

Instructions:

Simply include EMath.h in your file and link to -lEmath located in the lib directory.

EMath is a static library.

EMath is a plain C++ library so it can be compiled on a variety of Operating Systems.

Currently precompiled binaries are only available for the GCC or MINGW32 compiler, but I will provide more options in the future. i.e. .lib Visual Studio libraries.

Runs on Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.
