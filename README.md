# Epsilon Engine Mathematics
Open source math library used by the Epsilon Engine, oriented to game programmers.

Instructions:

Simply include EMath.h in your file and link to -lEmath located in the lib directory.

EMath is a static library.

EMath is a pure C++ library so it can be compiled on a variety of Operating Systems.

Currently precompiled binaries are only available for the GCC or MINGW32 compiler, but I will provide more options in the future.(.lib Visual Studio libraries, etc.)

Runs on Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

The library is not yet finished, so feel free to colaborate if you are interested.

It is intended to be used in 3D and 2D applications, with API independence in mind.
